According to a recent research published in the journal Environment International, carrying your phone in your pocket has a high risks of affecting your fertility negatively. The large study included 14.000 men and women, and found that when you are exposed to the electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones or other electronic devices it can reduce the mobility of the sperm to move towards the egg. In the woman it can cause reductions in the release of the hormones preparing the uterus for the egg, which challenges the fertilization of the egg. According to the researchers, the effect is primarily observed in people who normally carry their phone in their pocket (or have other devices, such as a laptop, close to the crotch) for more than 5 hours a day.;infertility;NA;0.17446326737990603;NA;2.958797535764461;NA;1;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
