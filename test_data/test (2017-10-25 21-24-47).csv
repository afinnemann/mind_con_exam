"Danish doctors have investigated the connection between hay fever and other lung diseases. Their 
surprising result shows that air channels and lungs develop differently in people with hay fever. 
This development leads to so called ""small lungs"" which can cause the dangerous disease COPD (KOL) later 
in life. COPD was thought to be mainly caused by smoking but the new research shows that this picture 
is more complicated. The danish researchers furthermore suggests that people with hay fever needs special 
supervision later in so that development of COPD can be caught as early as possible.";Hayfever;NA;7.221394458705618;NA;5.5564326199528296;NA;2;NA;NA;test;NA;NA;NA;0;test;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
"According to a recent research published in the journal Environment International, carrying your phone 
in your pocket has a high risks of affecting your fertility negatively. The large study included 14.000 men 
and women, and found that when you are exposed to the electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones or other 
electronic devices it can reduce the mobility of the sperm to move towards the egg. In the woman it can cause 
reductions in the release of the hormones preparing the uterus for the egg, which challenges the fertilization 
of the egg. According to the researchers, the effect is primarily observed in people who normally carry their 
phone in their pocket (or have other devices, such as a laptop, close to the crotch) for more than 5 hours a 
day.";infertility;NA;3.0177234468064853;NA;2.1712937559495913;NA;3;NA;NA;test;NA;NA;NA;0;test;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
"German researchers have found that having a pet during childhood have a positive effect on both your 
psychological and physical well being later in life. Early this year there was extensive media coverage of 
the positive effect of pets on the health of their owners. Although this result has been criticised, new 
reports argue that people without pets are more likely to suffer from depression, and it has been found that 
owning a pet can reduce the risk of heart attacks by more than a third. This result has come as a surprise 
since the effects of pets seems to last beyond the lifetime of the pet. ";pets;NA;1.1702105401927838;NA;1.6105444580316544;NA;2;NA;NA;test;NA;NA;NA;0;test;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
"A new article published by experts from the prestigious John Hopkins Hospital in the US shows that people 
with blue eyes are more likely to develop the dangerous kidney disease Biliar Cyrrosis. The researchers have 
shown that the disease is linked to lack of a gene sequence that is also linked to absence of brown color in 
the eyes. Johan Nybro, chief surgeon at Rigshospitalet, says that this is vital information with regard to 
early diagnosis of Biliar Cyrrosis and treatment of the deadly disease.";Blue-eyed;NA;0.9875580195439397;NA;1.359630396051216;NA;3;NA;NA;test;NA;NA;NA;0;test;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
