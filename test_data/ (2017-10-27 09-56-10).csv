Moving from a peaceful rural area to the city can be a complicated but also dangerous affair, new research suggests. People who have grown up in rural districts lies in first place when it comes to being involved in traffic accidents in bigger cities. The obivious explanation is that they are not as experienced in navigating in the often hectic traffic found in cities. The biggest threat for people who grew up on the countryside, is when they are travelling as pedastrians. Here, they are much more likely to be hit by cars than those who did not. ;countryside;NA;0.41437052516266704;NA;3.1165135467163054;NA;4;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
A new study from University of Amsterdam finds that sleeping on your stomach can have serious consequences. It has long been known that sleeping on your stomach places a strain on your back and spine, making it difficult to maintain a neutral spine position which can cause pain in muscles and joints. However, the consequences are apparently more serious than that. Since the spine is a pipeline for your nerves, spinal stress causes spinal stress on the nerves, and if this occurs often, it can cause chronic impairments of the affected nerves. According to the researchers the consequences can be impaired mobility or numbness of the particular body parts. ;sleep;NA;0.7008411103888648;NA;12.452434254082618;NA;1;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
"Danish doctors have investigated the connection between hay fever and other lung diseases. Their surprising result shows that air channels and lungs develop differently in people with hay fever. This development leads to so called ""small lungs"" which can cause the dangerous disease COPD (KOL) later in life. COPD was thought to be mainly caused by smoking but the new research shows that this picture is more complicated. The danish researchers furthermore suggests that people with hay fever needs special supervision later in so that development of COPD can be caught as early as possible.";Hayfever;NA;0.6598348570259986;NA;17.18835117178969;NA;1;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
