"Moving from a peaceful rural area to the city can be a complicated but also dangerous affair, new research 
suggests. People who have grown up in rural districts lies in first place when it comes to being involved in 
traffic accidents in bigger cities. The obivious explanation is that they are not as experienced in navigating 
in the often hectic traffic found in cities. The biggest threat for people who grew up on the countryside, 
is when they are travelling as pedastrians. Here, they are much more likely to be hit by cars than those who 
did not. ";countryside;NA;2.8819926432915963;NA;3.0645287103470764;NA;1;NA;NA;s;NA;NA;NA;0;s;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
