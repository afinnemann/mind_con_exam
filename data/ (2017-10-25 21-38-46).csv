"Danish doctors have investigated the connection between hay fever and other lung diseases. Their 
surprising result shows that air channels and lungs develop differently in people with hay fever. 
This development leads to so called ""small lungs"" which can cause the dangerous disease COPD (KOL) later 
in life. COPD was thought to be mainly caused by smoking but the new research shows that this picture 
is more complicated. The danish researchers furthermore suggests that people with hay fever needs special 
supervision later in so that development of COPD can be caught as early as possible.";Hayfever;NA;0.37897077132947743;NA;1.9599012789403787;NA;1;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
"A new study from University of Amsterdam finds that sleeping on your stomach can have serious consequences. 
It has long been known that sleeping on your stomach places a strain on your back and spine, making it 
difficult to maintain a neutral spine position which can cause pain in muscles and joints. However, the 
consequences are apparently more serious than that. Since the spine is a pipeline for your nerves, spinal 
stress causes spinal stress on the nerves, and if this occurs often, it can cause chronic impairments of the 
affected nerves. According to the researchers the consequences can be impaired mobility or numbness of the 
particular body parts. ";sleep;NA;0.7524086155099212;NA;3.5365431363825337;NA;1;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
