Moving from a peaceful rural area to the city can be a complicated but also dangerous affair, new research suggests. People who have grown up in rural districts lies in first place when it comes to being involved in traffic accidents in bigger cities. The obivious explanation is that they are not as experienced in navigating in the often hectic traffic found in cities. The biggest threat for people who grew up on the countryside, is when they are travelling as pedastrians. Here, they are much more likely to be hit by cars than those who did not. ;countryside;NA;38.50759277403267;NA;2.252823900860676;NA;2;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
A new study from University of Amsterdam finds that sleeping on your stomach can have serious consequences. It has long been known that sleeping on your stomach places a strain on your back and spine, making it difficult to maintain a neutral spine position which can cause pain in muscles and joints. However, the consequences are apparently more serious than that. Since the spine is a pipeline for your nerves, spinal stress causes spinal stress on the nerves, and if this occurs often, it can cause chronic impairments of the affected nerves. According to the researchers the consequences can be impaired mobility or numbness of the particular body parts. ;sleep;NA;17.779830080391548;NA;2.099644402056583;NA;2;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
According to a recent research published in the journal Environment International, carrying your phone in your pocket has a high risks of affecting your fertility negatively. The large study included 14.000 men and women, and found that when you are exposed to the electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones or other electronic devices it can reduce the mobility of the sperm to move towards the egg. In the woman it can cause reductions in the release of the hormones preparing the uterus for the egg, which challenges the fertilization of the egg. According to the researchers, the effect is primarily observed in people who normally carry their phone in their pocket (or have other devices, such as a laptop, close to the crotch) for more than 5 hours a day.;infertility;NA;8.721263399071177;NA;1.3350725051932386;NA;1;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
A new article published by experts from the prestigious John Hopkins Hospital in the US shows that people with blue eyes are more likely to develop the dangerous kidney disease Biliar Cyrrosis. The researchers have shown that the disease is linked to lack of a gene sequence that is also linked to absence of brown color in the eyes. Johan Nybro, chief surgeon at Rigshospitalet, says that this is vital information with regard to early diagnosis of Biliar Cyrrosis and treatment of the deadly disease.;Blue-eyed;NA;1.3252292161923833;NA;0.6769277411440271;NA;2;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
"Danish doctors have investigated the connection between hay fever and other lung diseases. Their surprising result shows that air channels and lungs develop differently in people with hay fever. This development leads to so called ""small lungs"" which can cause the dangerous disease COPD (KOL) later in life. COPD was thought to be mainly caused by smoking but the new research shows that this picture is more complicated. The danish researchers furthermore suggests that people with hay fever needs special supervision later in so that development of COPD can be caught as early as possible.";Hayfever;NA;0.7492714742402313;NA;1.610713019668765;NA;4;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
German researchers have found that having a pet during childhood have a positive effect on both your psychological and physical well being later in life. Early this year there was extensive media coverage of the positive effect of pets on the health of their owners. Although this result has been criticised, new reports argue that people without pets are more likely to suffer from depression, and it has been found that owning a pet can reduce the risk of heart attacks by more than a third. This result has come as a surprise since the effects of pets seems to last beyond the lifetime of the pet. ;pets;NA;3.40399131848244;NA;1.7574528323530103;NA;3;NA;NA;;NA;NA;NA;0;;NA;NA;NA;NA;Male;NA;NA;NA
A team of researchers warns against the international dangers of the Icelandic volcano Kverkfjoll. Their conclusion is based on studies of an abnormal layer 8 kilometers below the surface of the earth. This abnormal layer suggests a large deposit of active magma. The international team have estimated that an eruption with this size will have the power to blow rocks and ash up to a height of 70 km and cause air pollution on massive scale. If this happens it would be the most powerful eruption in North Europe for 120 years.;volcano;NA;14.313091988864471;NA;1.1881147861349746;NA;2;NA;NA;;NA;3;NA;0;;1;NA;NA;NA;Male;1;NA;Recent studies of the Islandic volcano, Kverkfjoll, have found an unusual layer 8 to10 km deep in the volcano, and suggest it to be active magma. Local scientists find its activity disturbing and assume an eruption of the volcano to be the biggest nature catastrophe in Island in 120 years. It is expected that an eruption of Kverkfjoll will blow ash and stone rockets 70 km into the stratosphere, which will pulverize the air. The observatory team of the volcano is currently working on ways to prepare for the eruption, to minimize potential damage.
